# Random Password Generator

This code is of a password generator app I made in Javascript as part of an assigned course project at Scrimba. The main features included in this project are:<br />
-> Set size of the passwords you would like to generate<br />
-> Randomized generation of passwords<br />
-> Include/exclude numbers and symbols in your generated passwords<br />
-> Click on the generated password field to copy the password to your clipboard (not sure if it works!)<br />
